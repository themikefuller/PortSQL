# PortSQL
Import / Export Functionality for SQLizer and SQLizerLite

PortSQL uses SQLizer (or SQLizerLite) to export and import tables from MySQL or SQLite databases. This implementation is currently in the early stages of development. Basic usage is discoverable through the test files for those brave enough to try it out.
